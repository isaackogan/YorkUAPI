This sequence culminates with notions of prices that maximize revenue subject to a given demand function. A large number of such topic sequences involving univariate functions are examined.

Again relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled andor derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of Economic issues and how they can be resolved. The issues and problems covered require functions of more than one variable for their resolution. The notion of Quantity Supplied is combined with the notion of Quantity Demanded and notions of Market Equilibrium are introduced and discussed. Equilibria are evaluated through the introduction of mathematical notions and properties of systems of equations eventually in matrix form. A deeper understanding of theories of demand supply and the foundations of demand supply functions is developed through the introduction of mathematical notions of unconstrained and constrained optimization and linear and nonlinear programming. As in APECON 1530 3.00 many topics and issues are addressed and problem framing and problem solving abilities are enhanced. Prerequisite: APECON 1530 3.00 or equivalent.
